Conversational Loan Assistant

A Python + GenAI Prototype for Loan Query Automation

Overview

This project implements a Conversational Loan Assistant that can answer natural-language questions about personal loan applications by reading structured and unstructured data from multiple sources:

Loan Application (PDF) ‚Üí Applicant details, amount, tenur
Interest Rates (Excel) ‚Üí Product variants, tenure-based rate
Terms & Conditions (PDF) ‚Üí Eligibility rules, penalties, repayment policies

If the answer isn‚Äôt found in the ingested documents, the assistant uses a Generative AI Fallback (simulated) to produce a relevant response.

Core Feature
Extract structured data from loan application PDFs
Parse interest rate tables from Excel
Read and index Terms & Conditions text
Answer user questions via CLI or REST API
Fallback to simulated GenAI for unmatched queries
Logging and health-check support
Containerized for easy deployment


Description:

cli_main.py ‚Üí Command-line conversational interface

api_main.py ‚Üí REST API (FastAPI)

genai_fallback.py ‚Üí Mock Generative AI fallback logic

ingestion.py ‚Üí Document ingestion & parsing (PDF/Excel)

qa.py ‚Üí Query analysis and response logic
